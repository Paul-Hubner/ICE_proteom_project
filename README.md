# ICE_proteom_project
I processed the fasta file before you gave us the functions to read them.
So in my script I created a new text file with the proteome without the sequence names. This file is present in the GitHub folder: clean_proteom.txt

<b> The graphics are not displayed in the notebook on GitHub, so they are in the folder.
